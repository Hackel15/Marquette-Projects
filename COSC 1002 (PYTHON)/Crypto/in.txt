	In the year 2011 I joined a new organization.  I entered the United States Navy.  After making the challenging decision to embark on an unknown journey I set off to boot camp.  My recruiter, in a drill instructor tone, said, “this is where you become a man, Mr. Hackel.”  At the time I couldn’t have been more excited, but looking back my recruiter may need a better choice of words.  Boot camp wasn’t a place where “men were made” it was a place that taught and upheld moral standards.  Our very first instruction in boot camp - learn the Navy Core Values: honor, courage, and commitment. A foundation that guides sailors of my kind to make the right decisions when others are not present.  With those three values I was able to uphold the Navy’s Mission statement, “to maintain, train and equip combat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas.”  This was our platform that served as instructions, a list of rules, prospects, and an expected outcome of the future.  
One year ago I finished my commitment with an honorable discharge.  Since then I’ve been pursuing my educational goals in computer science with much emphasis and passion - pressing forward to take classes each semester until I find the proper university to uphold my educational needs.  Marquette University would be the perfect option.  I’ve witnessed a family member and many friends prosper from Marquette’s education.  I’ve seen fellow shipmates become outstanding leaders from the ROTC program and I’ve even had the opportunity to be my sisters first salute outside of St. Joan of Arc Chapel a few years ago.  Marquette has already given me great memories but given the opportunity to study at your campus would allow me to create my own.  Thank you for your consideration.
