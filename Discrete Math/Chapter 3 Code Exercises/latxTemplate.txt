%If I want to write a note to myself that doesn't show up in the document, I begin it with a percent symbol.  These are called comments.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.] This is problem \#2.  Any time we use mathematical symbols or variables of any kind, we enclose them in dollar signs \$.  So I would write $3+4x=19$. If I want to offset this equation so that it stands out, I use double dollar signs to enclose the equation, as follows $$3+4x=19.$$  If I want the equation to be numbered, so that I can refer to it later, then I use the equation environment: 
\begin{equation}
\label{easy} %You don't have to label your equations, only if you want to refer to them later and not have to keep track of the numbering.
3+4x=19
\end{equation}

Since I labeled this equation, I can now refer to it by it's label: Consider equation \ref{easy}.

If you have several equations that you want to line up nicely, you can use the align environment:
\begin{align}
3x+5y-3z&=14\\
5x-2y+9z&=12\\
x+y+z&=10
\end{align}
The equations will align wherever you put the \& symbol.  Make sure to end each line with $\backslash \backslash$.  If you want to use the align environment, but you don't want the numbered equations, then use align*.
\begin{align*}
3x+5y-3z&=14\\
5x-2y+9z&=12\\
x+y+z&=10
\end{align*}

\item[5.] This is problem \#5.  If it has multiple parts, we label them as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item This is part a.
\item This is part b.
\item This is part c.
\item[(e)] Let's say there is not a part d, so part e is next.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Note that if I start a new line outside of the enumerate environment, it will automatically be indented, so if I don't want it indented, begin with the command $\backslash$noindent.

\noindent
To start a new line, you need to skip a line in the tex document.  

\vspace{0.1in}

If you want space between your lines you can use the command $\backslash$vspace\{??in\}.

\vspace{0.5in}

\noindent
If you ever have any questions, just google ``how do you \underline{\hspace{1in}} in latex," or come ask me.
